# ReviewsWebApp


Iglu.com technical test

 

The purpose of this test is to assess your knowledge of programming in the C# language and ability to leverage commonly used parts of the .NET framework's class library. It replicates a typical short piece of work – displaying customer reviews on one of Iglu.com’s sites, based on HTML/CSS provided by a designer (you will find this in the ReviewsWebApp/Views/Review/Index.cshtml view).

 

You will need to implement an MVC page to display customer reviews based on a file containing the data (located at ReviewsWebApp/reviews.json). The component should present the reviews in a paginated manner, with 3 reviews per page.

 

Please keep it simple and keep in mind maintainability and readability when writing your code. There is no expectation to write any documentation.

 

You can find a sample project on github - https://github.com/igludotcom/ReviewsWebApp - please clone this, make the necessary modifications to create a functional prototype. Once complete, please commit you changes locally, zip up the solution directory and send back to
